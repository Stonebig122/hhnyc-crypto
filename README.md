Welcome! Please read the following info and download the tools for your operating system. It will help make things easier for everybody.

**Very important caveat**: These tools MAY NOT be 100% effective. The latest information we have is that they are likely to help protect your communications, but governments including the U.S. have made progress in breaking or circumventing some cryptographic technologies.

If you or your source is truly a high-value target of a government, protecting yourself will require far more effort. To get an idea of what people do when they are *really* serious about security, please read this post first: http://grugq.github.io/blog/2013/06/13/ignorance-is-strength/
